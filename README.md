# demo_42_ros

## Description

Includes two basic 42 sim configurations to be used with icd_42_ros. One acts
as server to output data over sockets, the other will connect with it and
visulize that data. This occurs alongside the ROS node which also captures this
data.

These are nearly, if not exactly, identical to the Tx and Rx configurations in
the 42 project.
